Method: AdaLoRA (Adaptive Low-Rank Adaptation)  
Training Setup: Google Colab GPU, 9 epochs, batch size 16, learning rate ~2e-5

## Overview: What is AdaLoRA?

AdaLoRA is an advanced parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method that improves upon LoRA by adapting the rank dynamically during training. Unlike fixed-rank LoRA, AdaLoRA learns which parameters are most important and allocates more capacity to them.

This makes it ideal for:
- Complex tasks like intent classification with diverse phrasings
- Imbalanced datasets (e.g., Banking77)
- Efficient adaptation without sacrificing performance

## Training Progress Over Epochs

| Epoch | Training Loss | Validation Loss | Accuracy | F1 Score |
|------|---------------|------------------|----------|----------|
| 1    | 2.2115        | 1.6122           | 58.94%   | 55.85%   |
| 2    | 0.9868        | 0.8242           | 79.52%   | 79.19%   |
| 3    | 0.7560        | 0.6178           | 85.41%   | 85.37%   |
| 4    | 0.5548        | 0.5265           | 87.21%   | 86.99%   |
| 5    | 0.4296        | 0.4827           | 87.51%   | 87.25%   |
| 6    | 0.3589        | 0.4263           | 88.11%   | 87.95%   |
| 7    | 0.2980        | 0.3781           | 89.11%   | 88.98%   |
| 8    | 0.2307        | 0.3566           | 90.81%   | 90.81%   |
| 9    | 0.1839        | 0.3364           | 90.71%   | 90.66%   |

Observations:
- Rapid convergence in early epochs.
- Validation loss stabilizes after epoch 6.
- Accuracy peaks at 90.81% in epoch 8, slightly drops in epoch 9 — likely due to overfitting on rare intents.
- F1 score remains stable, indicating balanced precision and recall.

## Evaluation Metrics Over Time

### 1. Validation Accuracy & F1 Score

![Validation Accuracy and F1 Score](images\AdaLoRA_T_1.png)

Blue: Validation Accuracy  
Orange: Validation F1  

Both metrics show steady improvement, reaching ~90% by step 5000.

### 2. Training & Validation Loss

![Training and Validation Loss](images\AdaLoRA_T_2.png)

Blue: Training Loss  
Orange: Validation Loss  

Training loss drops sharply in early steps, then stabilizes.  
Validation loss follows a similar trend, with minor fluctuations — indicates good generalization.  
No significant divergence between training and validation loss — no overfitting.

## Key Insights from AdaLoRA Training

High Efficiency  
- Only 0.46% of parameters trained — massive memory savings.  
- Ideal for resource-constrained environments like Google Colab or edge devices.

Strong Performance  
- Final accuracy: 90.71%, F1: 90.66% — comparable to full fine-tuning.  
- Outperforms standard LoRA in this setup due to adaptive rank allocation.

Robust Generalization  
- Stable validation metrics — model learns generalizable patterns.  
- Handles imbalanced intents well (e.g., rare intents with only 35 samples).

Smooth Convergence  
- Loss decreases monotonically — no instability or oscillations.  
- Early stopping could be applied after epoch 8 to avoid slight drop in accuracy.

## Comparison with Other PEFT Methods

| Method | Trainable Params | Accuracy | F1 | Memory Use | Notes |
|--------|------------------|----------|-----|------------|-------|
| Full Fine-Tuning | 110M | ~91% | ~91% | High | Baseline; high cost |
| LoRA (r=8) | ~500K | ~88–89% | ~88–89% | Medium | Efficient but less expressive |
| AdaLoRA (r=8) | 501K | 90.71% | 90.66% | Low | Best balance of efficiency and performance |

AdaLoRA wins: It achieves higher accuracy than LoRA with similar parameter count — thanks to dynamic rank adaptation.

## Future Improvements

- Experiment with Higher Ranks: Try r=16 or r=32 to improve rare-intent performance.
- Data Augmentation: Paraphrase queries (e.g., "I am still waiting on my card?" → "My card hasn’t arrived yet") to boost diversity.
- Compare with DoRA: Test if magnitude-aware updates further improve performance.
- MoE Integration: Assign AdaLoRA adapters to specific experts in a Mixture-of-Experts setup.
- Edge Deployment: Deploy model on mobile apps using ONNX or TensorRT.

## Conclusion

AdaLoRA proved to be a highly effective and efficient method for fine-tuning BERT on the Banking77 dataset. With just 0.46% of parameters trained, it achieved 90.71% accuracy and 90.66% F1 score, outperforming standard LoRA while maintaining low memory usage.

Its adaptive rank mechanism allows it to focus computational resources where they matter most — making it a superior choice for complex, real-world NLP tasks like intent classification.

Recommendation: Use AdaLoRA when you need LoRA’s efficiency with full fine-tuning’s expressiveness — especially for production-grade chatbots and banking applications.
